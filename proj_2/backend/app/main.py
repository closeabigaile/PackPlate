"""PackPlate API entry point.

Layers (see proj_1b report, Figure 1):
    api/           presentation  - HTTP routes, one file per feature
    schemas/       response models shared by routes
    services/      business logic - hours, filter engine, crowd aggregation
    repositories/  data access   - the only layer that queries Postgres

The tables live in proj_2/db (shared with ingestion), so proj_2/ must be on
the Python path: see the README.
